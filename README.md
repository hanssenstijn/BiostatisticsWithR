## Babak Shahbaba: Biostatistics with R: An Introduction to Statistics Through Biological Data

Biostatistics with R is designed around the dynamic interplay among statistical methods, their applications in biology, and their implementation. The book explains basic statistical concepts with a simple yet rigorous language. The development of ideas is in the context of real applied problems, for which step-by-step instructions for using R and R-Commander are provided. Topics include data exploration, estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression analysis, and clustering with two appendices on installing and using R and R-Commander. A novel feature of this book is an introduction to Bayesian analysis.

This author discusses basic statistical analysis through a series of biological examples using R and R-Commander as computational tools. The book is ideal for instructors of basic statistics for biologists and other health scientists. The step-by-step application of statistical methods discussed in this book allows readers, who are interested in statistics and its application in biology, to use the book as a self-learning text.
